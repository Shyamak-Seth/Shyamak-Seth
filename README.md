- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shyamak-Seth
- 👀 I’m interested in making web apps, and I'm going to start learning Java, Python, etc in who-knows-how-much time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP... (in short, the basics of web development)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help make my understanding of complex coding better.

PS: Check out my website, it's awesome: https://simplyastute.000webhostapp.com
